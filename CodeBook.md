# Activity includes

Id.          Activity
1            WALKING
2   WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3   WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4            SITTING
5           STANDING
6             LAYING


The code runs as follow:

1. We read from the specified data files
2. we merge the data by column and merge the dataset by rows
3. we then use grep to locate mean/std from the features names
4. we change the description to characters. The names are already very descriptive, so it dosent seem necessary to change them more.
5. we made some changes to the name of the features to make them more descriptive
6. we calculate mean across activities/subjects.
